                                        <p class="answer">Hackathons are places where you can have many unique experiences. You can watch
                                        you and your team's project come to life throughout a weekend, network with sponsors in a
                                        much more casual environment than career fair, meet new friends and learn about the present
                                        tech community, and learn cool new tech that industry is thrilled to hear about!
                                        Come up with a project, or join a team, and make the coolest invention you've come up with yet!</p>

                                        <p class="answer">As a Major League Hacking member event, we require all attendees (hackers, volunteers,
                                        mentors, sponsors, etc) to follow Major League Hacking’s <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

                                        In the future when we're bigger, we hope to be able to help you out, so stay tuned!</p>

                                        <p class="answer">sunhacks exists to help combat those thoughts. We're working on building a community that people especially
                                        like you can be a part of. We want to help you defy those thoughts, find that network of support, and flourish! We focus on
                                        addressing these concerns by providing introductory workshops, encouraging mentors to interact with all hackers, and creating
                                        a positive environment.</p>

                                        We'd encourage you to work in a team so you can have people to learn from, bounce ideas off of, and break work down into manageable chunks! </p>

                                        who want to help you with your project—or maybe you want to help them with theirs! We have activities planned to help

                                        <p class="answer">MLH will be generously renting out cutting edge technology to the hackers. From Oculus Rifts to Arduinos,
                                        the sky is the limit. If you have hardware or tools, you are more than welcome to bring them as well.</p>

                                        <p class="answer">You'll need to bring a laptop, charger, any tech you might want to hack on or with. As we are a 3 day hackathon,
                                        we encourage you to bring toiletries and any other materials you deem relevant. We highly encourage you bring sleeping paraphernalia
                                        to ensure you get a good night's rest each night (or not, we understand you're excited to hack, but remember to take care of yourself!).
                                        We will have a sleeping area designated and showers will be provided! <br />In addition, sunhacks is working toward becoming a sustainable hackathon, that means
                                        we aren't providing water bottles this year, and are asking that you bring your own.</p>

                                        <p class="answer">To get the full hackathon experience we highly recommend you stay, but we understand if you need to leave
                                        (or if you want to sleep in a real bed for the night).</p>

                                        <p class="answer">sunhacks exists to help combat those thoughts. We're working on building a community that people especially
                                        like you can be a part of. We want to help you defy those thoughts, find that network of support, and flourish! We focus on
                                        addressing these concerns by providing introductory workshops, encouraging mentors to interact with all hackers, and creating
                                        a positive environment.</p>

                                        We'd encourage you to work in a team so you can have people to learn from, bounce ideas off of, and break work down into manageable chunks! </p>

                                        <p class="answer">You'll need to bring a laptop, charger, any tech you might want to hack on or with. As we are a 3 day hackathon,
                                        we encourage you to bring toiletries and any other materials you deem relevant. We highly encourage you bring sleeping paraphernalia
                                        to ensure you get a good night's rest each night (or not, we understand you're excited to hack, but remember to take care of yourself!).
                                        We will have a sleeping area designated and showers will be provided! <br />In addition, sunhacks is working toward becoming a sustainable hackathon, that means
                                        we aren't providing water bottles this year, and are asking that you bring your own.</p>
